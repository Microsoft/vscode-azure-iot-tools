## What's New (v0.3.0)  
### Azure loT Hub Toolkit
### Added
* Update infrastructure to support localization (Thanks [@matsujirushi](https://github.com/matsujirushi)!)
* Localization for Japanese language (Thanks [@matsujirushi](https://github.com/matsujirushi)!)
* Expose API to read IoT Hub connection string

### Changed
* Use OS credential store to store IoT Hub connection string (To be more secure, we will no longer use `azure-iot-toolkit.iotHubConnectionString` in settings.json to store IoT Hub connection string)

### Azure loT Edge
### Changed
* ASA error message improvement
* Rename 'tempSensor' to 'SimulatedTemperatureSensor'
* Read connection string from API of Azure IoT Hub Toolkit

### Azure loT Device Workbench
### Added
- We are excited to announce the preview of a new feature enabled in Azure IoT Device Workbench extension in VS Code to simplify the device cross-compiling toolchain acquisition effort for device developers working on embedded Linux devices (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Yocto Linuxâ€¦) with Azure IoT by encapsulating the compilers, [device SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) and essential libraries in [Containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). All you need is to install or upgrade the IoT Device Workbench and [get started](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/tree/containerized-toolchain-readme) developing within the container, just like today you are using a local environment.

### Fixed
- Fix the issue of "MXCHIP AZ3166 serial port button not work" [#661](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/issues/661) which started after update to VS Code 1.36.0.

Special thanks to [br1pro](https://github.com/br1pro) and [Remco Ploeg](https://github.com/rploeg), thanks for your feedbacks.

## Azure IoT Services
- Develop and connect your [Azure loT Applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/) to Azure using the [Azure loT Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit). With this extension, you can interact with an Azure loT Hub, manage connected devices, and enable distributed tracing for your Azure loT applications.

- Develop and debug [Certifies Azure loT Devices](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/alldevices) (including [MXChip loT DevKit](http://www.mxchip.com/az3166), [ESP32](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/details?title=ESP32_DevKitC&source=all-devices-page), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/category/288)) to Azure using the [Azure loT Device Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-iot-workbench). The loT Device Workbench extension makes it easy to code, build, deploy and debug your loT applications with popular loT development boards.

- Develop and deploy artificial intelligence and your custom logic to [Azure loT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/) with [Azure loT Edge for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-edge). Azure loT Edge extension makes it easy to code, build, deploy, and debug your loT Edge applications.

## Installation
By installing this extension you will install all of the extensions listed above. Some of these extensions will have a dependency on the [Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) to provide a single Azure login and subscription filtering experience.

You can easily uninstall individual extensions if you are not interested in using them, without affecting other extensions provided by this pack. You can uninstall all of the extensions by uninstalling the Azure Tools extension.

## Setup Azure IoT Hub for Extension
After successfully installing this extension, you can follow the steps below to setup your IoT Hub. you can use **IoT Hub connection string** or **sign in to Azure** to select IoT Hub:

#### Setup Azure IoT Hub through Connection String
You can use IoT Hub connection string to setup your IoT Hub

1. In Explorer of VS Code, click "Azure IoT Hub Devices" in the bottom left corner.

2. Click "Set IoT Hub Connection String" in context menu.

3. An input box will pop up, then enter your IoT Hub Connection String (It is one-time configuration, and please make sure it is **IoT Hub Connection String** and not **Device Connection String**. The format is `HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=<my-policy>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>`).

4. The device list will be shown.

5. Then you can manage your devices and interact with Azure IoT Hub through context menu.

> **NOTE**: You can also go to **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** (**Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings**), and update the configuration of `azure-iot-toolkit.iotHubConnectionString` to change your IoT Hub Connection String.

#### Setup Azure IoT Hub through Sign in to Azure

Instead of copying and pasting to set IoT Hub Connection String, you can sign in to Azure and select IoT Hub from your Azure Subscription.
1. In Explorer of VS Code, click "Azure IoT Hub Devices" in the bottom left corner.

2. Click "Select IoT Hub" in context menu.

3. If you have not signed in to Azure, a pop-up will show to let you sign in to Azure.

4. After signing in, your Azure Subscription list will be shown, then select an Azure Subscription.

5. Your IoT Hub list will be shown, then select an IoT Hub.

6. The device list will be shown.
